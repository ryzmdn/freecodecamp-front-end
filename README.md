# FreeCodeCamp Front-end Projects

I'm very happy to have completed all the certified Front End Development Libraries Projects from the [freeCodeCamp curriculum](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries), which use a combination of **HTML**, **JavaScript**, **CSS**, **Bootstrap**, **SASS**, **React**, **Redux**, and **jQuery**. In this repository, I will share examples of the syntax for the **5 projects** I've completed. You can also use them to solve any issues you encounter while working on your own projects.

## Projects in this Repository

1. **Quote Machine**: A random quote generator that fetches a new quote and author each time the user clicks a button. It also includes a feature to share quotes on Twitter.

2. **Markdown Previewer**: A markdown editor and previewer that updates the rendered output in real time as the user types. It supports GitHub-flavored Markdown syntax.

3. **Drum Machine**: A virtual drum pad interface where users can click buttons or use keyboard shortcuts to play sounds. The displayed text updates dynamically based on the sound played.

4. **JavaScript Calculator**: A fully functional calculator that supports basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also handles operator precedence and edge cases.

5. **25 + 5 Clock**: A Pomodoro-style timer where users can set a 25-minute work session and a 5-minute break. It features a countdown timer, audio notification, and customizable session/break durations.

## Features

- Fully responsive designs.
- Code structured to follow best practices.
- Comprehensive examples to help debug or understand the projects.
- Modular components for easy reuse.
